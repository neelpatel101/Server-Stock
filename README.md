# Server Stock C Application

This is a C-based application I wrote that creates a server with two CSV files on various stocks using server.c. client.c allows a client to connect to the server and pass commands such as asking for the maximum profit or finding the stock on a given date. Multiple clients can be connected and disconnected at any point using multithreading.
